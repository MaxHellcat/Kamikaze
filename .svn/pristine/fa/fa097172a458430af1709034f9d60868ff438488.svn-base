						The Project Settings Guidelines

- The "Compile For Thumb" option must be set to NO. This is required for proper Neon compilation





						The Project Notes

- The project doesn't use XIB files in any means, all window/view creation is done manually




						Possible Pitfalls

- Routines sinf_neon() and cosf_nean() of the Neon library are known to work not well, causing
	different artifacts when drawing, or weirdly disabling drawing altogether
